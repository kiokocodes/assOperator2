// Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

var a = 9;

// initialization of a variable and assigning it a value within the same line


/*

The let keyword declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned a new value later in the code. 

The const keyword declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned a new value once it is initialized. 

The var keyword declares a variable with function scope (or global scope if declared outside a function), 
and the variable can be reassigned a new value later in the code.



In addition to these keywords, you can also declare a variable without an initial value using any of these keywords. For example:

// Declare a variable called a using let, but do not initialize it with a value
let a;

// Declare a constant called b without initializing it with a value
const b;

// Declare a variable called c using var, but do not initialize it with a value
var c;
